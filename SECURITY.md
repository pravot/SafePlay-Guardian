# Security Policy

## Overview

We are dedicated to ensuring the security and integrity of our project and its users. This document outlines our policies and procedures for identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities in our codebase. 

## Supported Versions

We prioritize security updates and patches for the latest major release. The following table outlines the versions of the project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark:  |
| 0.0.0   | :x:                |
| 0.0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we ask that you report it to us through secure and private channels. We strongly advise **against disclosing the vulnerability in public forums, issue trackers, or discussion boards**.

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**: 
   - Use the [GitHub private vulnerability reporting tool](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to submit your report. This ensures that only the maintainers of the repository can view your report.
   - Include the following information:
     - **Description of the vulnerability**: Provide a detailed description of the issue, including any relevant code snippets or examples.
     - **Impact**: Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access, etc.).
     - **Steps to Reproduce**: If applicable, provide step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
     - **Suggested Mitigation**: If you have an idea of how to fix the issue, please include your suggestions.

2. **Confidentiality**:
   - We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your report. We will only share details of the vulnerability with the individuals who need to know in order to address it.
   - We will work with you to determine how to disclose the vulnerability publicly after it has been resolved.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**:
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours**. You will receive a confirmation message that your report is being reviewed.

2. **Assessment**:
   - Our security team will assess the vulnerability to determine its validity, severity, and potential impact.
   - We may reach out to you for additional information or clarification during this stage.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we will develop a fix and prepare a patch.
   - We will aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within **14 days**. For non-critical vulnerabilities, the timeline may vary, but we will keep you updated on our progress.

4. **Communication**:
   - We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process, including when a fix has been developed, tested, and deployed.
   - If we determine that the vulnerability is not valid or does not pose a significant risk, we will explain our reasoning.

5. **Public Disclosure**:
   - After the vulnerability has been resolved, we will work with you to determine the appropriate timing and content of a public disclosure.
   - You will be credited for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous. 

## Security Best Practices

We recommend the following security practices to maintain a secure development environment:

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Keep your dependencies and packages up to date to mitigate risks from known vulnerabilities.
  - Review and apply security patches as soon as they become available.

- **Code Reviews**:
  - Perform thorough code reviews, especially for changes that affect security-critical areas of the codebase.
  - Use automated tools to scan for common security issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication.

- **Access Control**:
  - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting access only to those who need it.
  - Regularly audit access permissions and revoke unnecessary access promptly.

- **Encryption**:
  - Use strong encryption for sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.
  - Avoid hardcoding secrets or sensitive information in your codebase. Use environment variables or secure vaults instead.

- **Incident Response**:
  - Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate any security breaches.
  - Regularly test your incident response plan to ensure your team is prepared to respond effectively.
