# Security Policy

## Overview

We are committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our project. This document outlines our policies and procedures for identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities. Our primary goal is to ensure that any vulnerabilities are identified and resolved promptly, minimizing risks to users and maintaining the integrity of our project.

## Supported Versions

We prioritize security updates and patches for the latest major release. The following table outlines the versions of the project that are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.0   | :white_check_mark:  |
| 0.0.0   | :x:                |
| 0.0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it directly to us using secure and private channels, rather than public forums, to allow us to address the issue before it is publicly disclosed.

### How to Report

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**:
   - Use the [GitHub private vulnerability reporting tool](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to submit your report.
   - Your report should include a detailed description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and steps to reproduce the issue if applicable.

2. **Confidentiality and Acknowledgment**:
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and begin our investigation.
   - All reports are treated with strict confidentiality. Details will only be shared with those necessary to resolve the issue.

## Addressing Vulnerabilities

### Our Approach

1. **Assessment and Prioritization**:
   - Upon receiving a report, our security team assesses the vulnerability's severity and potential impact. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on this assessment to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.

2. **Resolution**:
   - We work to develop and deploy a fix as quickly as possible. For critical issues, this may involve an out-of-cycle release. Less severe issues are addressed in the next scheduled release.

3. **Notification and Disclosure**:
   - Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will notify the reporter and may publicly disclose the issue through a security advisory. We will credit the reporter unless they choose to remain anonymous.

## Identifying Vulnerabilities

### Proactive Measures

1. **Automated Security Scanning**:
   - We use automated tools to continuously scan our codebase for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies and the code itself. Alerts are generated and sent to maintainers if any issues are detected.

2. **Code Reviews**:
   - All contributions undergo thorough code reviews by experienced maintainers, focusing on identifying potential security weaknesses. This ensures that any new code follows security best practices and does not introduce vulnerabilities.

3. **Security Audits**:
   - Periodic security audits are conducted by internal or external experts to review the codebase and identify any new or previously unnoticed vulnerabilities.

4. **Security Training**:
   - Our team regularly participates in security training to stay updated on the latest security best practices and emerging threats. This helps ensure that contributors are aware of common security risks and how to avoid them.
